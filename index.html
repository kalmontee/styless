                    <p class="right">Hello world, my name is Kelvin Almonte. A little quick brief about myself, I graduated from Syracuse University with a bachelors of Science, majored in Human Development and Family Science. I am an aspiring self-taught programmer. I have been self teaching myself how to code for 13 months, and now I am currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to take my skills to the next level. I am excited to attack this opportunity and secure a dream job that I have been waiting for eons.

                        Why programming? In my early years, I was always had a strong passion with technology but never really focus myself into it. I was much more of an athlete. Sports was my main passion. However, everything changed when I met a software engineer and convinced me to try and learn programming. It was at that moment I dedicated myself to learn programming.
                        <br> 
                       If there's anything amazing about programming, is the ability to always keep learning. It's challeging, fulfilling, and of course, major headaches.
